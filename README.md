# DustyDisk
```DustyDisk``` is a python package created during the code/astro 2025 workshop at Northwestern University (CIERA). 

Authors: SM Gopika & Miranda Pikus. Affiliation: Department of Physics and Astronomy at Purdue University

The ```DustyDisk``` package serves as an aide to model and visualize the hydrodynamical behavior of dust in astrophysical disks, particularly for the application of planetary formation. Using hydrodynamic principles, ```DustyDisk``` takes in system parameters such as the temperature and gas density profile for an astrophysical system, then computes and visualizes the dust properties and distribution.

Check out our tutorial jupyter notebook in ```Examples/ExampleTutorial.ipynb``` to get started. Further documentation can be found here: https://dustydisk.readthedocs.io
