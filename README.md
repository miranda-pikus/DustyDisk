# DustyDisk
```DustyDisk``` is a python package created during the code/astro 2025 workshop at Northwestern University (CIERA). 

Authors: SM Gopika & Miranda Pikus.

The ```DustyDisk``` package serves as an aide to model and visualize the hydrodynamical behavior of dust in astrophysical disks, particularly for the application of planetary formation. Using hydrodynamic principles, ```DustyDisk``` takes in system parameters such as the temperature and gas density profile for an astrophysical system, then computes and visualizes the dust properties and distribution.
